# Verbinding
Connecting the connected house...

## Description of Project:
Simple 'if...then....else' conditions to make multiple connected devices communicate with each other. When there is a Fifrefox OS connected hub, connecting all devices in a connected house, Verninding will make these devives communicate with each other.
eg. If the temperature in the room in more than 25'C, switch on the AC. In this case, a simple 'if...else' statement will communicate with the thermostat device and the AC to solve a life program.

## The technical how:
Taking the building blocks from different connected device projects and connect those using simple 'if...then....else' conditions. This is expected to be similar to IFTT...but for connected devices.
